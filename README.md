# data_analysis_challenge
Use csv file to analyse data
This project include data file(.csv extension) as  well as the output of the program


1 Child Mortality
In this first part of Task 2, you should write a Python script that reads and
analyses the child mortality data file (WHOSIS_MDG_000003.csv) and
produce at least FIVE useful graphs that give insight into the data trends.
You should produce the following graphs:

1. graph the infant mortality rates of all countries in 1990, sorted from
lowest rate to highest rate. (If the graph is too crowded, you can show
just each 10 th country, or show the first 10 and last 10 countries).   (Question1.py, Question1_)

2. graph the infant mortality rates as above, but for 2015.       (Question2.py, Question2_)

3. choose three representative countries in different areas of the world,
then create a line graph showing the trends in infant mortality in those
countries over the years from 1990 to 2015.               (Question3.py, Question3_)


4. for those same three countries, graph the reduction in infant mortality
rates over the 1990/2015 period - that is, the 1990 rate divided by the
2015 rate.                                                (Question4.py, Question4_)


5. a graph of your choice... (explain why you chose that graph, and what
conclusions you draw from the graph).                        (Question5.py, Question5_)






2 Child Mortality and Country Types
In this second part of Task 2, you should write another Python script that
reads and analyses the country metadata (COUNTRY.json) and merges it
with the child mortality data from Part 1, to allow you to do some higher-level
analysis of infant mortality trends.
Your report should include at least two graphs that display or compare infant
mortality in different regions of the world (using the &#39;WHO_REGION&#39; string to
group the countries).
You report should include at least two graphs that compare infant mortality
across different income groupings (using the
&#39;WORLD_BANK_INCOME_GROUP&#39; string to classify the countries).
